  "ingredients": [
    "\\textbf{For the brioche:}",
    "400g bread flour",
    "170g milk",
    "50g sugar",
    "1 tsp. salt",
    "1 tsp. vanilla",
    "2 tsp. yeast",
    "2 large eggs",
    "60g oil",
    "\\textbf{For the filling:}",
    "1 cup packed brown sugar",
    "3 tsp. cinnamon",
    "2 tbsp. butter",
    "\\textbf{For the icing:}",
    "8 oz room temperature cream cheese",
    "2 c. powdered sugar",
    "1 stick softened butter",
    "heavy cream to thicken mixture"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Pour all of the ingredients except oil into a mixing bowl.",
    "Mix on low until dough comes together, then add in oil until it combines.",
    "Knead the dough until it passes the window pane effect. Because this is a very enriched dough, may take 10 minutes or more in a stand mixer.",
    "Form a boule, and place it in a lightly oiled boil, and allow it to rise until doubled, or about one hour.",
    "While the dough is proofing, make the cinnamon filling.",
    "Remove the dough and flatten it out into a rectangle of about 12 inches x 15 inches.",
    "Spread evenly the filling, ``leaving about a 0.5 inch space on one edge to fold over'' (who knows what that means).",
    "Roll the rectangle up, and slice it into 14 rolls, then place those in a baking pan. Leave these until they have doubled in size.",
    "Bake for about 20 minutes at 350F.",
    "While baking, make the icing by creaming all ingredients together. Mix in some heavy cream until it is slightly thinned and will stiffly pour onto the buns.",
    "Let them cool slightly, then apply the cream cheese topping."
