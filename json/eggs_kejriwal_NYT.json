  "ingredients": [
    "1 tablespoon softened butter",
    "2 thick slices Pullman bread",
    "2 teaspoons mustard",
    "4 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated",
    "1 serrano chile, finely sliced",
    "2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, washed and chopped",
    "1 tablespoon minced red onion",
    "2 eggs",
    "Salt and pepper, to taste",
    "Ketchup, optional"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Butter the bread on both sides, and lightly brown in a frying pan (use the pan you like most for frying eggs). Smear one side of the toasts with mustard, and transfer to a sheet pan, mustard-side up. Turn on the broiler.",
    "Mix together the cheese, chile, cilantro, and onion, then split the mixture evenly between the toasts. Place under the broiler just until the cheese is melted.",
    "While the cheese is melting, fry the eggs in the same pan you used to make the toast, until the white edges are crisp, but the yolks are still soft. Gently loosen the eggs from the pan, and slide one on top of each toast. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with ketchup on the side, if you like."
