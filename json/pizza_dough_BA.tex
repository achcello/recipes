\section{Notes}

I usually make this recipe as it is, but it can also be done with a cold proof, so 12-24 hours in the refrigerator instead of 1-2 hours at room temperature.

\section{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 3/4 cup warm water (105F to 115F)
    \item 1 envelope active dry yeast
    \item 2 cups (or more) all purpose flour
    \item 1 teaspoon sugar
    \item 3/4 teaspoon salt
    \item 3 tablespoons olive oil
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pour 3/4 cup warm water into small bowl; stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast dissolves and activates, about 5 minutes.
    \item Brush large bowl lightly with olive oil. Mix 2 cups flour, sugar, and salt in processor. Add yeast mixture and 3 tablespoons oil; process until dough forms a sticky ball.
    \item Transfer to lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky, about 1 minute.
    \item Transfer to prepared bowl; turn dough in bowl to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
    \item Punch down dough, and form pizza.
\end{enumerate}
