  "notes": "I usually make this recipe as it is, but it can also be done with a cold proof, so 12-24 hours in the refrigerator instead of 1-2 hours at room temperature.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3/4 cup warm water (105F to 115F)",
    "1 envelope active dry yeast",
    "2 cups (or more) all purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon sugar",
    "3/4 teaspoon salt",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil"
  ],
  "method": [
    "Pour 3/4 cup warm water into small bowl; stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast dissolves and activates, about 5 minutes.",
    "Brush large bowl lightly with olive oil. Mix 2 cups flour, sugar, and salt in processor. Add yeast mixture and 3 tablespoons oil; process until dough forms a sticky ball.",
    "Transfer to lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky, about 1 minute.",
    "Transfer to prepared bowl; turn dough in bowl to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
    "Punch down dough, and form pizza."
